      <h1 class="heading">Why saving money is bad?</h1>
      <p>The typical Indian middle class mentality is to save first before you spend. From childhood, many of us are exposed to save our money on a bank or post office deposits.<br/><br/></p>
      <p>
        This is because of the fact that the hard earned money stays secure in those savings instruments. These instruments rely on issuer's promise to pay a guaranteed rate of interest on the amount invested.
        The post office and bank deposite rates are widely known. But the impact of "inflation" is widely ignored.<br/><br/> To explain this, we have a calculator and a table below.<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab_content">
        <comp-calc class="tab_item"></comp-calc>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align:right; font-size: medium;font-weight: 800;margin-top: 15px;">[Note: The sudden fall in inflation from 2014 is mostly due to base effect.]</div>

      <p>
      As you can see the calculator just gives you compound interest + principal, i.e., compounded amount for given rate of interest and time period. <br/><br/>The table on the right tells you about how inflation erodes the money every year. <br/>[All inflation rates are taken from world bank data]<br/><br/>
      For example, in 2005 if you had invested Rs. 1000/- on a 7% yearly compound interest, then on 2020 its real growth is just 1.46%. How is this calculated? <br/>
      Year 2005, I have invested Rs.1000 and the money should have grown to Rs. 1070/- by the year end. Then comes our enemy inflation at 4.2% and takes away Rs. 44/- (approx) from the compounded amount. Hence, the actual money growth is just Rs. 1026.41/- <br/>
      Likewise, each and every year's interest and inflation is calculated and presented the real growth of money in the table.<br/> <br/>
      Look at the inflation numbers from 2008 to 2013 and the corresponding real returns. For about 6 years the yield was negative. <br/><br/>

      Hence, whenever we save money in deposites, it is equivalent to burning our money slowly.
